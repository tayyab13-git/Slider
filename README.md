## PanGesture slide-in half modal Bottom Card for UIKit + Swift

### Video tutorial : https://youtu.be/cI3Bzmq4EgY
Why it is here: I spent the whole day creating a slide-out half modal screen for one of the freelance projects and just had to create a tutorial about it. Partly because was asked when I shared the result on Instagram, but mostly for future self do not browse documentation and tutorials again a few months later :)

* Works fine and tested on Xcode 11 & 12 
* Used UIKit, UIPresentationController, and GestureRecognizer to get this result.
